# IOT-BASED-WATER-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Water being an important commodity is becoming scarce due to droughts and overuse Water is naturally abundant and readily available source in nature. But now a day's lot of ground water level is decreased due to the excess amount of water wastage. And thus, supply the water to all the industries and people; hence water management is essential. Therefore, we have focused on developing the water management system using IOT technology. The proposed water management system using ESP 32 module and sensors, is used to measure all the parameters like water quality, water level and water consumption etc., in real time and can be remotely reviewed over smart phones. The proposed system addresses the flow rate measuring and scheme adopted for the supply of water in order to limit the water wastage by using solenoid valve, also can measure the quantity and quality of water distributed to every household by using flow rate sensors and PH-sensor respectively. The results of the proposed system are discussed and presented.
